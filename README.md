# WALLPAP-ENG-resource

resource of [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/), almost all come from favorite anime.  
used [shields.io](https://shields.io/) to show some datac.  
used [markserv](https://github.com/markserv/markserv) to preview `draft.md`.  
see [table-resource.md](/table-resource.md). (there are few useful `csv` files.)

## why the video file so big

the uploader had not yet mastered the skill of compressing the video at that time.  
and then he didn't want to break consistency.

## license

all these videos on [steamcommunity](https://steamcommunity.com/), their copyrights belong to the producer, etc ðŸ‘®
